	There is a bug that I can't reproduce here on either the 
	linux or sun boxes for version of perl 5.003 -> 5.8x so I've
	added a trap in get_ns.t to check hosts for problems with 
	resolver not returning the local host name server IP addy's
	Hopefully, someone will find such a host and provide a user
	account so I can find the problem and fix it.

	DOCUMENTATION change only.
	correct the comments for $put->CNAME,MB,MG,MR,NS,PTR
	erronously said that $rdlength was an input ARG when
	it is actually calculated and inserted by the function

0.15  Sat Nov  1 09:44:17 PST 2003
	change RR module instantiation from eval {some code}
