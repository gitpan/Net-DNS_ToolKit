To install the Perl and C libraries, simply run:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

This distribution has been tested on linux version 2.4.19, 
perl 5.006 with gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release).

Linux version 2.2.16, perl 5.00503 with
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)

If you have older versions of gcc, don't bother,
gcc version 2.7.2.3 does not work with this distribution.

On systems with older gcc versions, you may get linker errors such as:

  ld: cannot open -lresolv: No such file or directory

This indicates that while the resolver library /lib/libresolv.so.2, 
was found, the linker could not use it because the file does not
have the required file name. ld wants files of the form .../libresolv.a

More recent versions of gcc / ld do not have this problem. 
There are two solutions.

1) install a newer version of gcc
2) provide a soft link of the correct name

  i.e.	cd /usr/lib
	ln -s /lib/resolv.so.2 libresolv.a
